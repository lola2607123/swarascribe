Melakarta ragas are the main ragas with a set scale of seven notes used in both ascending and descending order, forming the basis for many others.

I’ve been learning and exploring this traditional form of South Indian classical music for 7 years and have fallen completely in love with it. My goal is to deepen my understanding of its rich history, techniques, and melodies, while sharing my journey with others who appreciate the beauty of Carnatic music. My passion for Carnatic music started when I first listened to a young girl named Sooryagayathri. At the time, she was 3 years older than me, and I wanted to be just like her. My motivation for making this website was to share my interest in this historic art form with those who are also captivated by the intricate rhythms and deep emotional expression in Carnatic compositions. I find joy in learning new ragas and perfecting my skills in vocal or instrumental performances. Whether it’s through my practice, research, or performances, I’m constantly inspired by the complexity and beauty of this art form.''')

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss music or collaborate!")
